I'm a software engineer in National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN), Indonesia. My research is in the intersection of remote sensing, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. 

My current research activities are:
- crop growth monitoring using SAR and optical remote sensing data fusion
- oil spill segmentation and data processing pipeline
- object measurement using stereo vision and deep learning

Biography
======
I was born and grew up in Bandung, Indonesia, where I also took undergraduate program in Electrical Engineering in Institut Teknologi Bandung. My final capstone project was on the development of train information system and passenger announcement system. 

I also participated in several competitions and voluteering activities during my college years. One of the competition which I was involved in developing  energy harvester for mobile phone  won 2nd place in a student competition in Surabaya. In the final year, I was involved in volunteering activity on mentoring high school students in outskirt of Bandung to pursue higher education.

Previous Experiences
------
After graduation, I worked as software developer for several telecommunication companies and a digital agency where I learned software engineering practices and web development. In 2018, I joined Agency for The Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) as an engineer where I was involved in several research activities such as the development of fire danger rating system for forest fire, IoT gateway using APRS and MQTT, land cover modeling using machine learning, and crop monitoring from remote sensing.

In 2021 BPPT merged into BRIN, where I joined Research Center for Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security, under Computer Vision and Image Processing Research Group.
